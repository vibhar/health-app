iWorkOut! 

This application is a health journal that helps track and graph your routine
for exercising. You can plan out your exercises and food for the day, and at 
the end of the day submit a journal entry where you report what you actually 
completed. You can also check your progress by viewing the weight graph of 
the past week as well as the exercises you completed in the past on the 
calendar. 

Stay (regularly) healthy. We're watching you.

How to run:
first in terminal run: node app.js
then in chrome go to: localhost:8889/

Note: this is a single page web app so there are no other pages to vist other
than the index page
