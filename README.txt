iWorkOut! 

This application is a health journal that helps track and graph your routine for exercising. You can plan out your exercises and food for the day, and at the end of the day submit a journal entry where you report what you actually completed. You can also check your progress by viewing the weight graph of the past week as well as the exercises you completed in the past on the calendar. 

Stay (regularly) healthy. We're watching you.
