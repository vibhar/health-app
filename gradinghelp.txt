User Testing
Some of the key points we listened to were
1. We made the plan the default screen instead of journal
2. In plan screen we pulled the entire form together to ensure
   that the two components type and description intuitively go together
   and both are required
3. Add some color and more styling to the list in plan along with background 
   color associated with type
4. We made our title more aesthetically appealing. 
5. We added the planning items to the journal page so that the user would not 
   have to retype them. 


Design Process
We first came up with the idea of the health journal and then started coming
up with functionality that we wanted to have. From this we tried to tailor
the design to the functionality. As we change the functionality the design 
generally changed.
